    <p>The status effect of Slash b.svg Slash damage is Bleed. It applies a DoT effect after a 1 second delay, dealing a tick of damage each second for 6 seconds. Each tick deals damage equal to  0.35 × Modded Damage × (1 + Faction Damage Mods) as TrueDmg b.png True damage. Multiple instances of the effect can stack on the same target, with each instance having its own timer, but only up to 10 tick numbers are actually shown, the rest are hidden to save performance.<p></p>

            <p></p>Because Bleed scales off of the base damage of the weapon, the amount of damage dealt is not affected by elemental mods nor physical-type mods like Mod TT 20px.png Contagious Spread and Mod TT 20px.png Buzz Kill, but is affected by Faction Damage Mods and Base Damage mods like Mod TT 20px.png Pressure Point. <p></p>
            
           <p></p> Slash b.svg Slash procs scale with damage multipliers such as Headshots and Critical Hits, which greatly increases the damage dealt. However weakspots generated by Sonar130xDark.png Sonar or Mod TT 20px.png Detect Vulnerability only increase the initial hit, not the DoT.<p></p>
            
           <p></p> For example, tick damage for a weapon with an innate 100 damage, Mod TT 20px.png Serration, and Mod TT 20px.png Bane of Grineer will be:<p></p>
            
           <p></p> Modded Damage = 100 × (1 + 1.65) × (1 + 0.3) = 344.5<p></p>
           <p></p> Tick damage = 0.35 × 344.5 × (1 + 0.3) = 156.7475<p></p>
           <p></p> As can be seen in the above calculations for tick damage, Faction Damage is applied twice, making their effective bonus = (1+Faction Bonus)^2. Which is +69% for the 30% Faction Damage mods and +140.25% for the 55% Primed Faction Damage mods.<p></p>
            
           <p></p> While bleeding, the target will have small bursts of blood come out every fraction of a second where they were hit to trigger this proc. Machinery and Robotic enemies will instead bleed oil.<p></p>
            
           <p></p> Mods that affect Finisher melee attacks (e.g. Mod TT 20px.png Finishing Touch and Mod TT 20px.png Savage Silence) have no effect on TrueDmg b.png True damage, and as such do not interact with Slash b.svg Slash procs in any special way.<p></p>
            
           <p></p> Because the damage from this status effect is TrueDmg b.png True damage, it can bypass Ferrite Armor and Alloy Armor, which can help compensate for Slash b.svg Slash damage's penalty against armor.</p>
